# I2C

## Introduction

### I2C Other Names
- I2C other names I2C, I sqaure C, Two wire interface and TWI

### I2C Lines
- SCL: Serial Clock
  - For synchronizing data transfer between the master and the slave.

- SDA: Serial Data
  - The Data line

- Both lines are connected with the Pull-Up resistor both lines are connected to VCC via Pull up resistor

### Operation Modes
- Master Transmitter
- Master Receiver
- Slave Transmitter
- Slave Receiver

### Key Factors

- Transactions are initiated and completed by the master
- All messsages have an address frame and a data frame
- Data is placed on the SDA lines after scl goes low, and it is sampled after the SCL line goes high

### Frame Format

![i2c frame format](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84496147/152824646-ce5b15d8-7e1c-45e2-ad1a-7c7d51c23a70.PNG)

- All transactions begin with START and are terminated by STOP
- A **HIGH to LOW transition** on the SDA line while **SCL is HIGH** defines a **START** condition
- A **LOW to HIGH transition** on the SDA line while **SCL is HIGH** defines a **STOP** condition
- START and STOP conditions are always generated by the master
- The Bus is considered to be free again a certain time after the STOP Condition
- The Bus stays busy if a repeated START is generated instead of a STOP condition

#### Byte Format
- Any information transmitted on the SDA line must be eight bits long
- Number of bytes that can be transmitted per transfer is unrestricted, we can transfer n bytes
- Each byte must be followed by an Acknowledge (ACK) bit
- Data is transferred with the Most Significant Bit (MSB) first

### Address Frame
- Address frame is first in any new communication sequence
- For a 7-bit address, the address is sent out siginificant bit (MSB) first, followed by a R/W bit indicating whether this is a read(1) or write(0) operation
