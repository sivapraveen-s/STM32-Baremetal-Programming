# GPIO

MCU Pins are grouped into PORT

PA1 = PORT A Pin #1

2 Types of GPIO

- General Purpose Input/Output (General function of the pin)
- Special Purpose Input/Output (Special -or- Alternate function of the pin eg: UART,I2C, ADC etc.)


# GPIO Common Registers

MCUs GPIO Modules have atleast 2 registers

- Direction Register: Used to Set pin as Input -or- Output
- Data Register     : Used to Write to pin -or- Read from pin
